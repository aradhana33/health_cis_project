# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Canadian Health & Income Dashboard (Django Project)

This project is a full-stack data analytics application that explores and visualizes key hypotheses using Canadian Health Survey and Canadian Income Survey datasets. It uses Django on the backend and presents insights through interactive dashboards.
---
## Project Summary

We built a robust analytics pipeline that:
- Merges and processes real-world data from two national surveys (CIS & CHS)
- Tests multiple social and economic hypotheses
- Presents results in a visually engaging, user-friendly dashboard

## Hypotheses Explored

1. **Gender Pay Gap**  
   > Do males earn consistently more than females across provinces and age groups?

2. **Province-wise Health vs Income**  
   > Is there a correlation between income levels and self-reported health in different provinces?

3. **Work Hours vs Mental Health**  
   > Do longer work hours correlate with poorer mental health?

4. **Education vs Earnings**  
   > How does educational attainment affect income across age groups?

5. **Government Assistance Impact**  
   > What role does government support play in reported health and income stability?
