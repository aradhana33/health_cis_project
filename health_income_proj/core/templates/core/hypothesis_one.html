    <h1> Hypothesis 1: Gender, Education & Income</h1>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
        <p>We hypothesize that gender has a statistically significant effect on income, even after adjusting for education level. We also test whether there's an interaction between gender and education on income.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The ANOVA results indicate that both gender and education significantly affect income. 
            Moreover, the interaction term confirms that the impact of education on income varies by gender.
            This suggests that the gender pay gap persists across education levels.
